  </header>
  <p>(As it relates to article contributors)</p>
  <h3><u>Preamble</u></h3>
  <p>This details our responsibility to keep your information safe and our obligation to use your data responsibly. Our obligations are detailed in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the 2018 amendments. This policy will clarify such obligations. This is so that you know what your rights are, and to ensure that you know how we handle your information and work.</p>
  <h3><u>1: Personal data should be obtained and processed fairly and lawfully.</u></h3>
  <p>This means that we have to ensure that you know what information about you we hold. We will only hold the information you give us and we will only publicly display your information at your consent. You can withdraw your information at any time. Please note that information about your gender, sexual orientation, race, religious beliefs, criminal record, and sexual history have even more stringent protections.</p>
  <h3><u>2: Personal data can be held only for specified and lawful purposes.</u></h3>
  <p>This means that we cannot use your information for any reasons you have not been made aware of. It also means that we cannot use your information in cases you withdrawn permission for. We cannot use your information for illegal activity. This protects you from activity such as extortion, blackmail, cyber bullying, and illegal data selling.</p>
  <h3><u>3: Personal data should be adequate, relevant, and not excessive for the required purpose.</u></h3>
  <p>This means that we cannot ask for information that does not relate to your capacity as a user or contributor on our site. You can give us excessive information if you wish, but we must ensure that you know what is needed and what is not needed.</p>
  <h3><u>4: Personal data should be accurate and kept up to date.</u></h3>
  <p>If any of the personal data we hold about you changes, you must notify us of the change. We must ensure that all the data we hold about is accurate at the present moment. We cannot hold information about you that is misleading, or incorrect, or that can be used as slander. Slander is defined as the spreading of information with no source, validation, or accuracy, with the intent to damage the reputation of the data subject.</p>
  <h3><u>5: Personal data should not be kept for longer than necessary.</u></h3>
  <p>If you were to ever rescind your status as a contributor or delete your account, we must not hold your information anymore. We will not keep copies of denied articles, we will not keep copies of denied contributor applications. We will not keep copies of your articles if you wish for us to take them down.</p>
  <h3><u>6: Data must be processed in accordance with your rights.</u></h3>
  <p>You have the right to inspect the information we hold about you. We must remove any information about you if you ask us to do so, with one notable exception: If we legally obtain incriminating information, we are under a legal obligation to seek the counsel of law enforcement officials.</p>
  <h3><u>7: Appropriate measures must be taken against unauthorised access.</u></h3>
  <p>This means that we must, to the best of our ability, protect your information against malware, malicious users, doxxing, and users without clearance. If your information is compromised, we must notify you. You have the right to know who is authorised to view and handle your data. You too are under an obligation to protect your own data. You must take precautions like a strong account, limiting what information you publish, and logging out when you are not using your account.</p>
  <h3><u>8: Personal data cannot be transferred to countries that do not have similar legal protections of your information.</u></h3>
  <p>If we ever transfer your information out of state, we must have your permission. We cannot transfer your information to a country that does not have data protection legislation.</p>
  <p>Intellectual property.</p>
  <p>(<em>Disclaimer: This only applies to those with contributor status</em>)</p>
  <p>We will not publish any articles that plagiarize the work of others. Quotations must be appropriately referenced and sourced. Equally, you have the right to be credited for your work. We must cooperate with contributors to prevent the plagiarisation of their work and to give them appropriate credit. We will not publish any slanderous articles. Slander is here defined as the spreading of information with no source, validation, or accuracy, with the intent to damage the reputation of the person or organisation.</p>
